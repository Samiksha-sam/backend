MVC : A widely used design pattern

Model :- related to data (untill we learn DB, we are going to use dummy arrays)
View :- HTML/template that is visible to user
Controller :- a.k.a handler - core entity responsible for processing the incoming request


working:
    - user will make request to controller to manipulate data   
    - that data (model) will update the view
    - updates view will be seen
    Example : 
       1. 10 products shown to user
       2. he deleted 1 product(via controller)
       3. controller will undate/manipulate data(in model)
       4. user will see 9 products in view
